The Kin Rewards Engine incentivises developers to create amazing user experiences that utilize Kin.

This is done via a shared 'Daily Payout' that can be as high as 250,000,000 Kin.

## Daily Payout

Developers can increase their possible portion of the `Daily Payout` by simply encouraging their users to obtain and spend Kin

Those developers who create the biggest consumer demand and use for Kin receive the biggest daily rewards. There are controls put in place to promote fairness for newer/smaller apps that reduce the possibility of a monopoly.

'Daily Payouts' are sent to approved developers on a weekly basis.

## How We Handle Gaming of the KRE and Prevent Monopolies

To be eligible to participate in the KRE, apps must first build a functioning integration on the devnet and then [apply for an AppIndex](/essentials/kre-app-registration/#register-your-app) in our Kin developer portal. By having a valid App Index, we are able to verify ecosystem appsâ€™ Kin based transactions and user balances.

Apps are regularly audited, manually and programmatically (via transaction data), to ensure they are creating positive user experiences, are improving the overall Kin ecosystem, and are meeting our [Spend Checklist](/essentials/kre-checklist), [Developer Terms](https://kin.org/kin-developer-terms/), and [Terms of Use](https://kin.org/terms-and-conditions/) to remain eligible to receive rewards from the KRE.

In order to prevent monopolies, we implement a 'Monopoly Clause' that prevents an App or specific combination of Apps from taking too much fo the KRE.

## The Future of the KRE

The KRE is not fixed in stone, it continues to evolve over time to make sure it serves the Kin community as effectively as possible.

We are open for suggestions and are happy to receive proposals from members of our community that can become part of the discussion for how Kin and the KRE proceeds into the future.
