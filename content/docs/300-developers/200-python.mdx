## Get Started or Add to an Existing Project

Getting started with Kin is incredibly straightforward. Just follow the steps below to start transacting with Kin in your app.

### Installation

```shell
pip install kinetic-sdk
```

### Instantiate the Kinetic Client

The Kinetic Client will give you access to all the methods you need to work with Kin on the blockchain.

We recommend starting with Devnet before moving on to Mainnet.

```python
from kinetic_sdk import KineticSdk

kinetic_client = KineticSdk.setup(
    environment='devnet', # mainnet or devnet,
    index=1, # your App Index
    endpoint='https://sandbox.kinetic.host/', # devnet endpoint
)
```

Don't have an App Index? Register your app on our Developer Portal so you can get your App Index that allows you to transact with our SDKs and earn via the KRE.

While you're waiting for confirmation of your App Index, use `1` on devnet so you can get started.

<RegisterApp />

### Create Account

You can create accounts from existing mnemonics or secret keys. In this case we'll generate a mnemonic and use that to creat the keypair we use for creating the account on the blockchain.

```python
from kinetic_sdk import Keypair, Commitment

mnemonic = Keypair.generate_mnemonic()
keypair = Keypair.from_mnemonic(mnemonic)

kinetic_client.create_account(
    owner=keypair,
    commitment=Commitment.Finalized
)
```

### Check Balance

```python
balance = kinetic_client.get_balance(account=keypair.public_key)
```

### Airdrop Funds (devnet)

```python
airdrop = kinetic_client.request_airdrop(
    account=keypair.public_key,
    amount='1000',
    commitment=Commitment.Finalized
)
```

### Transfer Kin

```python
from kinetic_sdk import TransactionType

transfer = kinetic_client.make_transfer(
    amount='5000',
    destination='BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MAqVo',
    owner=keypair,
    type=TransactionType.P2P, # Optional, can be Unknown, None, Earn, Spend or P2P
    reference_id='some id', # Optional, stored off-chain and returned via webhooks
    reference_type='some reference', # Optional, stored off-chain and returned via webhooks
    sender_create=false # Optional, will make a Kin Token Account at that destination if true
)
```

Note - `referenceId` and `referenceType` are stored off chain and will be passed back to the app via webhooks if they are set up.

### Transfer Kin Batch

```python
from kinetic_sdk import Destination

destinations = []

destinations.append(
  Destination(
    amount='500', destination='BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MAqVo'))

destinations.append(
  Destination(
    amount='600', destination='BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MAqVo'))

destinations.append(
  Destination(
    amount='800', destination='BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MAqVo'))

batch_transfer = kinetic_client.make_transfer_batch(
    owner=keypair,
    destinations=destinations,
    reference_id='some id', # Optional, stored off-chain and returned via webhooks
    reference_type='some reference', # Optional, stored off-chain, returned via webhooks
    sender_create=false # Optional, will make a Kin Token Account at that destination
)
```

### Get Transaction Details

```python
transaction = kinetic_client.get_transaction(signature='transaction id string')
```

### Get Solana Explorer URL

[Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/)

```python
explorer_url = kinetic_client.get_explorer_url('transaction id string')
```

### Get Account History

```python
history = kinetic_client.get_history(account=keypair.publicKey)
```

### Webhooks

In [Kinetic Manager](/docs/developers/kinetic-manager/), you can configure your app to use the following webhooks:

### Events Webhook

This webhook can be used to receive information about completed transactions.

E.g. In a Python server with `Flask` / `flask-cors`:

```python
@cross_origin()
@app.route('/events', methods=['POST'])
def events():
    print('request_body: ', request.body)
    # DO STUFF WITH EVENT DATA
    response = '', 200
    return response
```

### Verify Webhook

This webhook can be used to verify transactions.

E.g. In a In a Python server with `Flask` / `flask-cors` return a `200` status code to approve the transaction:

```python
@cross_origin()
@app.route('/verify', methods=['POST'])
def events():
    print('request_body: ', request.body)
    # CHECK THAT YOU WANT THIS TRANSACTION TO PROCEED
    # Return 200 if you do
    response = '', 200
    return response
```

## Demos and Starter Kits

## Developer Best Practices

Once you're ready to code, have a quick look at our [Developer Best Practices](/essentials/best-practices/) where we cover some useful topics that you'll want to keep in mind as you build out your Kin application.

<BestPractices />

## Upgrading to Kinetic from Agora?

<Agora />

Here, we will outline the key API changes from the old version of our SDK to the new Kinetic version.

**General notes**

- For methods that request Kin be transferred, `amount` is the amount of Kin, not quarks.
- Response objects from requests have updated / changed.

**Instantiate the Kin Client**

```python
// Kinetic
import { KineticSdk } from '@kin-kinetic/sdk'
const kinClient = await KineticSdk.setup({ environment, index })

// Agora
import { Client } from '@kinecosystem/kin-sdk-v2'
const kinClient = new Client(env, { appIndex })
```

**Create Account**

```python
// Kinetic
await kinClient.createAccount({ owner: keypair })

// Agora
await kinClient.createAccount(privateKey)
```

**Check Balance**

```python
// Kinetic
const { balance } = await kinClient.getBalance({ account })

// Agora
const balance = await kinClient.getBalance(publicKey)
```

**Airdrop Funds (devnet)**

```python
// Kinetic
await kinClient.requestAirdrop({ account, amount })

// Agora
await kinClient.requestAirdrop(tokenAccountPublicKey, quarks)
```

**Transfer Kin**

```python
// Kinetic
await kinClient.makeTransfer({ amount, destination, owner, type, referenceId, referenceType, senderCreate })

// Agora
await kinClient.submitPayment({ quarks, destination, sender, type })
// The Agora invoice option has been replaced by 'referenceId' and 'referenceType'
```

**Transfer Kin Batch**

```python
// Kinetic
const destinations = [{ destination, amount }]
await kinClient.makeTransferBatch({ owner, destinations })

// Agora
const earns = [{ destination, quarks }]
await kinClient.submitEarnBatch({ sender, earns })
```

**Get Transaction Details**

```python
// Kinetic
const signature = 'transaction id string'
await kineticClient.getTransaction({ signature })

// Agora
import bs58 from 'bs58'
const transactionBuffer = bs58.decode(transactionId)
const data = await kineticClient.getTransaction(transactionBuffer)
```

**Webhooks**

In Agora, we used the `sign_transaction` webhook. That's been deprecated and we now have the `verify` webhook that can simply return a 200 status code to confirm verification of a request.
