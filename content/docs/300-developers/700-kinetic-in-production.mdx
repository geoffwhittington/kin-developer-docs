## Are You Ready?

Before moving your application onto the Mainnet, it's good practice to make sure you're able to transact on the Devnet. If it's all working how you want, then let's get going!

## Connecting to Mainnet

When you set up your Kinetic Client using one of our SDKs, you need to set your environment.

This can be either `devnet` or `mainnet`. For Production, you should choose `mainnet`.

For example, here's how it works with the TypeScript SDK:

```js
const clientOptions = {
  environment: 'mainnet', // mainnet or devnet
  index: 1, // your App Index
  endpoint: 'https://your_kinetic_instance', // kinetic instance endpoint
}

const kineticClient = await KineticSdk.setup(clientOptions)
```

You'll notice in the example above, you have to pass in an `endpoint` when you set up the Kinetic Client. <br/> This setting gives us some options in the ways we can connect to Kinetic on mainnet:

<div className="mt-8 grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2">
  <NavCard
    title="Self Hosted"
    subtitle="Host and manage your own Kinetic instance for maximum power."
    svgFile="server-solid"
    link={{ url: '/docs/developers/kinetic-in-production/#self-hosted', label: 'Learn more' }}
  />
  <NavCard
    title="Kinetic As A Service"
    subtitle="Connect to a Kinetic Service hosted by a 3rd party."
    svgFile="globe-solid"
    link={{ url: '/docs/developers/kinetic-as-a-service', label: 'Coming Soon!' }}
  />

</div>

## Self Hosted

For larger scale apps or those looking for more control.

- Get insights into your transactions
- Get insights into your hot-wallet usage
- Configure multiple mints (e.g. other tokens, nfts, etc)
- Stay on a specific Kinetic version
- Unlimited log retention
- Configure multiple hot-wallets
- Customisable (Open Source)

### Connecting To Your Own Kinetic Instance

Point to `mainnet` as your `environment` and set your `endpoint` to where you've deployed your own Kinetic Instance.
E.g. TypeScript SDK:

```js
const clientOptions = {
  environment: 'devnet', // mainnet or devnet
  index: 1, // your App Index
  endpoint: 'https://your_kinetic_instance', // your kinetic server address
}

const kineticClient = await KineticSdk.setup(clientOptions)
```

Your `endpoint` can be your own deployed Kinetic instance or a locally running instance.

<div className="mt-8 grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2">
  <NavCard
    title="Host Kinetic"
    svgFile="server-solid"
    link={{ url: '/docs/developers/kinetic-hosting', label: 'Time to Deploy!' }}
  />
  <NavCard
    title="Run Kinetic Locally"
    svgFile="docker-brands"
    link={{ url: '/docs/developers/kinetic-hosting#running-kinetic-locally', label: 'Go Local' }}
  />
</div>

### Configuration

<div className="mt-8 grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2">
  <NavCard
    title="Configure Kinetic"
    subtitle="Set your Environment Variables and use Kinetic Manager to configure and manage your Kinetic instance."
    svgFile="screwdriver-wrench-solid"
    link={{ url: '/docs/developers/kinetic-configuration', label: 'Get fiddling...' }}
  />
</div>

## Kinetic As A Service

<div className="mt-8 grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2">
  <NavCard
    title="Kinetic As A Service"
    subtitle="Connect to a Kinetic Service hosted by a 3rd party."
    svgFile="globe-solid"
    link={{ url: '/docs/developers/kinetic-as-a-service', label: 'Coming Soon!' }}
  />
</div>

### How To Connect

Just point to `mainnet` as your environment when you instantiate your Kinetic Client via your SDK of choice.
E.g. TypeScript SDK:

```js
const clientOptions = {
  environment: 'mainnet', // mainnet or devnet
  index: 1, // your App Index
  endpoint: 'kin_kinetic_endpoint', // get this from your KAAS provider
}

const kineticClient = await KineticSdk.setup(clientOptions)
```

That's it!
