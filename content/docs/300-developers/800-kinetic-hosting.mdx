Here we'll explain how you can deploy your own Kinetic instance to an online service such as [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) or [Render](https://www.render.com) and how to run Kinetic locally.

## Deploying Kinetic

Follow these steps to get your own version of Kinetic deployed to the web.

### Fork Kinetic

Fork you own version of Kinetic that we'll use for the deployment.

<div className="mt-8 grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2">
  <NavCard
    title="Fork Kinetic"
    icon="github"
    link={{ url: 'https://github.com/kin-labs/kinetic/fork/', label: 'Use the fork...' }}
  />
</div>

### Sign Up To A Hosting Service

<div className="mt-8 grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2">
  <NavCard
    title="Render"
    subtitle="Render offers free and paid services you can use to run Kinetic."
    pngFile="render"
    link={{ url: 'https://dashboard.render.com/', label: 'Sign Up / Log In' }}
  />
  <NavCard
    title="Heroku"
    subtitle="Heroku offers paid services you can use to run Kinetic."
    pngFile="heroku"
    link={{ url: 'https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/', label: 'Sign Up / Log In' }}
  />
</div>

### Create A New App

Create a new app using your preferred service and connect it to your forked Kinetic repo.

### Set Up A PostrgreSQL Server

You'll need a database to run Kinetic. See how to setup and connect to your DB here:

- [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/new/database) allows you to set up a separate PostreSQL server.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/postgres) allows you to install a PostrgeSQL db directly into a project as an addon.

### Prepare Your Environment Variables

Kinetic handles some of it's configuration via environment variables.

See the full list of environment variables <a href='https://github.com/kin-labs/kinetic/blob/main/.env.example' target='_blank'>here</a>.

Here are some gotchas to look out for:

- `COOKIE_DOMAINS` must contain your deployed url for your version of Kinetic, e.g. `my-kinetic-instance.onrender.com`.
- `DATABASE_URL` must be the url of your deployed PostgreSQL instance.
- Any url that contains `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` should be changed to `0.0.0.0` or whatever url you have deployed to.
- On Heroku, make sure not to include quote marks around your strings as Heroku won't filter them out.<br/>

### Deploy Kinetic

Once your environment is prepared, you're ready to deploy! Fingers crossed!

Make sure to check out the logs in case something goes wrong.

If something goes wrong and you can't figure it out, never fear!

### Open your app

That's it! You should be good to go. Open your app and log in via the method you specified in your environment variables.

You're now using Kinetic Manager!

<KineticManager />

## Running Kinetic Locally

### Requirements:

```shell
Node.js 14+
Docker 20+
Yarn v1.22+
```

### Get Started

To get started with Kinetic, pull down the [Kinetic](https://github.com/kin-labs/kinetic) repo and install dependencies.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:kin-labs/kinetic.git
cd kinetic
yarn install
```

### Prepare Your Local Environment Variables

Kinetic is highly configurable, but don't worry, we've provided an example file you can use to get started quickly.<br/>
Just copy the contents of the `.env.example` file into your own `.env` file.<br/>
See the full list of environment variables <a href='https://github.com/kin-labs/kinetic/blob/main/.env.example' target='_blank'>here</a>.

### Make sure Docker Is Running

<div className="mt-8 grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2">
  <NavCard title="Docker" svgFile="docker-brands" link={{ url: 'https://www.docker.com/', label: 'Get it here' }} />
</div>

### Run Kinetic Services

Then, in separate terminals, do each of the following:

- run the database

```shell
yarn dev:services:postgres
```

- prepare the database

```shell
yarn prisma migrate reset && yarn prisma db push
```

- run Solana locally (`localhost:8899`) or set `SOLANA_DEVNET_RPC_ENDPOINT=devnet` and skip this step

```shell
yarn dev:services:solana
```

- run the Kinetic API (`localhost:3000`)

```shell
yarn dev:api
```

- run the Kinetic Manager (`localhost:4400`)

```shell
yarn dev:admin
```

- run the Kinetic Demo App (`localhost:4200`)

```shell
yarn dev:demo
```

### Open The Kinetic Manager

- Kinetic Manager is a full-featured GUI for Kinetic
- You can log in using the details set in your `.env` file.
- [Click here](http://localhost:4400) to open localhost:4400

<KineticManager />

### Open The Kinetic Demo

- Use the built-in Kinetic Demo to test Kin transactions on your Kinetic instance
- [Click here](http://localhost:4200) to open localhost:4200
