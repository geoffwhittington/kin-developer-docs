Here we'll explain how you can deploy your own Kinetic instance to an online service such as [Render](https://www.render.com) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and how to run Kinetic locally.

<div className="mt-8 grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2">
  <NavCard
    title="Host Kinetic"
    svgFile="server-solid"
    link={{ url: '/docs/developers/kinetic-hosting#deploying-kinetic-to-heroku', label: 'Time to Deploy!' }}
  />
  <NavCard
    title="Run Kinetic Locally"
    svgFile="docker-brands"
    link={{ url: '/docs/developers/kinetic-hosting#running-kinetic-locally', label: 'Go Local' }}
  />
</div>

## Quick Start

<div className="w-full">
  <NavCard
    title="Kinetic Starter"
    subtitle="A quick starter that'll get you up and running with minimal changes and only one command!"
    svgFile="docker-brands"
    link={{ url: 'https://github.com/kin-starters/kinetic-docker-compose', label: 'Ready, set...' }}
  >
    Install Docker, set your{' '}
    <a href="/docs/developers/kinetic-hosting#kinetic-environment-variables">Environment Variables</a> directly in the
    `docker-compose.yml` file and run `docker-compose up` to get started.
  </NavCard>
</div>

## Deploying Kinetic

Follow these steps to get your own version of Kinetic deployed to the web.

### Fork Kinetic

Fork you own version of Kinetic that we'll use for the deployment.

<div className="mt-8 grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2">
  <NavCard
    title="Fork Kinetic"
    icon="github"
    link={{ url: 'https://github.com/kin-labs/kinetic/fork/', label: 'Use the fork...' }}
  />
</div>

### Sign Up To A Hosting Service

<div className="mt-8 grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2">
  <NavCard
    title="Render"
    subtitle="Render offers free and paid services you can use to run Kinetic."
    pngFile="render"
    link={{ url: 'https://dashboard.render.com/', label: 'Sign Up / Log In' }}
  />
  <NavCard
    title="Heroku"
    subtitle="Heroku offers paid services you can use to run Kinetic."
    pngFile="heroku"
    link={{ url: 'https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/', label: 'Sign Up / Log In' }}
  />
</div>

### Create A New App

Create a new app using your preferred service and connect it to your forked Kinetic repo.

### Set Up A PostrgreSQL Server

You'll need a database to run Kinetic. See how to setup and connect to your DB here:

- [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/new/database) allows you to set up a separate PostreSQL server.
- [Heroku](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql) allows you to install a PostrgeSQL db directly into a project as an addon.

### Prepare Your Environment Variables

Kinetic handles some of it's configuration via environment variables.

See the full list of environment variables <a href='https://github.com/kin-labs/kinetic/blob/main/.env.example' target='_blank'>here</a>.

### Deploy Kinetic

Once your environment is prepared, you're ready to deploy! Fingers crossed!

Make sure to check out the logs in case something goes wrong.

If something does go wrong and you can't figure it out, never fear!

### Get Started With Kinetic Manager

That's it! You should be good to go. Open your app and log in via the method you specified in your environment variables.

You're now using Kinetic Manager!

<KineticManager />

## Running Kinetic Locally

Slightly more involved, but will give you a great understanding of the services that work together to make Kinetic.

### Requirements

```shell
Node.js 14+
Docker 20+
Yarn v1.22+
```

### Get Started

To get started with Kinetic, pull down the [Kinetic](https://github.com/kin-labs/kinetic) repo and install dependencies.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:kin-labs/kinetic.git
cd kinetic
yarn install
```

### Prepare Your Local Environment Variables

Kinetic is highly configurable, but don't worry, we've provided an example file you can use to get started quickly.<br/>
Just copy the contents of the `.env.example` file into your own `.env` file.<br/>
See the full list of environment variables <a href='https://github.com/kin-labs/kinetic/blob/main/.env.example' target='_blank'>here</a>.

### Run Docker

<div className="mt-8 grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2">
  <NavCard title="Docker" svgFile="docker-brands" link={{ url: 'https://www.docker.com/', label: 'Get it here' }} />
</div>

### Run Kinetic Services

Then, in separate terminals, do each of the following:

- run the database

```shell
yarn dev:services:postgres
```

- prepare the database

```shell
yarn prisma migrate reset && yarn prisma db push
```

- run Solana locally (`localhost:8899`) or set `SOLANA_DEVNET_RPC_ENDPOINT=devnet` and skip this step

```shell
yarn dev:services:solana
```

- run the Kinetic API (`localhost:3000`)

```shell
yarn dev:api
```

- run the Kinetic Manager (`localhost:4400`)

```shell
yarn dev:admin
```

- run the Kinetic Demo App (`localhost:4200`)

```shell
yarn dev:demo
```

### Open The Kinetic Manager

- Kinetic Manager is a full-featured GUI for Kinetic
- You can log in using the details set in your `.env` file.
- [Click here](http://localhost:4400) to open localhost:4400

<KineticManager />

### Open The Kinetic Demo

- Use the built-in Kinetic Demo to test Kin transactions on your Kinetic instance
- [Click here](http://localhost:4200) to open localhost:4200

## Configuring Kinetic

Kinetic configuration is split between settings your can change in Kinetic itself, and also Environment Variables.

### Kinetic Manager

For more on configuring Kinetic, check out Kinetic Manager.

<KineticManager />

### Kinetic Environment Variables

See the full list of environment variables for Kinetic <a href='https://github.com/kin-labs/kinetic/blob/main/.env.example' target='_blank'>here</a>.

Here are some things to look out for:

#### Some Gotchas

- `COOKIE_DOMAINS` must contain your deployed domain for your version of Kinetic, e.g. `my-kinetic-instance.onrender.com`.
- `DATABASE_URL` must be the url of your deployed PostgreSQL instance.
- Any url that contains `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` should be changed to `0.0.0.0` or whatever domain you have deployed to.
- On Heroku, make sure not to include quote marks around your strings as Heroku won't filter them out.<br/>

#### Changing Your Auth Method

- `AUTH_PASSWORD_ENABLED=true` will turn on password authentication.
- You can also use GitHub, Discord or Google Logins. Follow the instructions in the `env.example` file linked above.
