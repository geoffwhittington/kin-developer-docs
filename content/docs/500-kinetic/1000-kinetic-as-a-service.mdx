If you want to connect to Kinetic on mainnet without running your own Kinetic server, then Kinetic As A Service is the way forward.

## How To Connect

Instantiate your Kinetic Client via your SDK of choice with the `endpoint` set to the endpoint provided by your Kinetic As A Service provider.
E.g. TypeScript SDK:

```js
const clientOptions = {
  environment: 'mainnet', // mainnet or devnet
  index: 1, // your App Index
  endpoint: 'kinetic_as_a_service_endpoint', // get this from your KAAS provider
}

const kineticClient = await KineticSdk.setup(clientOptions)
```

Don't have an App Index? Register your app on our Developer Portal so you can get your App Index that allows you to transact with our SDKs and earn via the KRE.

<RegisterApp />

## Kinetic As A Service Providers

When you connect to a Kinetic As A Service provider, you'll need to give them information about your app, including your App Index, so make sure you've registered your app.
