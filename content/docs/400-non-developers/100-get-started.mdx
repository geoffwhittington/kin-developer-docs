## Get Started or Add to an Existing Project

Getting started with the Kin No-Code Plugin is incredibly straightforward. Just follow the steps below to start transacting with Kin in your App.

### Create an App on Bubble.io

First, register / log in on [bubble.io](https://bubble.io)

<Bubble />

Then create an App. Give it a name, description, etc. Bubble has a nice App creation wizard you can follow if you'd like.

If you get stuck at this point, you'll probably want to check out [Bubble Academy](https://bubble.io/academy) to get some pointers. There are some great tutorials for beginners that will help get you up to speed with what Bubble is and how you can build an App with it.

### Add the Kinetic Plugin

Once you've created your App, you'll see a menu on the left hand side. Choose 'Plugins'. Then, 'Add plugins'.

Search for 'kinetic', then 'Install' and 'Done'.

### Configure the Kinetic Client

Go to 'Plugins' and you'll see some details about the Kinetic plugin that you've just installed, as well as some options we can fill in.

These 'Actions' are the things that the Kinetic plugin can do.

'Local Storage' means that some information is being saved in the browser.
The main actions we care about are the ones listed below.

In terms of settings, lets keep it simple for now so we can get up and running as quickly as possible.

Set your environment to 'devnet' as we want to make sure stuff works on the Solana test environment before moving to the 'mainnet'.

Set your 'index' to your App Index

Don't have an App Index? Register your App on our Developer Portal so you can get your App Index that allows you get credit for your tansactions and earn via the KRE.

### Initialise the Kinetic Client

Turn on the Kinetic Client by...

### Create Account

You can create accounts from existing mnemonics or secret keys. In this case we'll generate a mnemonic and use that to creat the keypair we use for creating the account on the blockchain.
