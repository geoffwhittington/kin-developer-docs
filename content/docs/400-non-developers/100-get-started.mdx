Building your own App on Bubble with the Kin Kinetic Plugin is incredibly straightforward. Just follow the steps below to start transacting with Kin in your App.

## Create an App on Bubble.io

First, register / log in on [bubble.io](https://bubble.io)

<Bubble />

Then create an App. Give it a name, description, etc. Bubble has a nice App creation wizard you can follow if you'd like.

If you get stuck at this point, you'll probably want to check out [Bubble Academy](https://bubble.io/academy) to get some pointers. There are some great tutorials for beginners that will help get you up to speed with what Bubble is and how you can build an App with it.

## Add the Kinetic Plugin

Once you've created your App, you'll see a menu on the left hand side. Choose 'Plugins'. Then, 'Add plugins'.
![Bubble Plugins](/images/no-code/Bubble_plugins.png)

Search for 'kinetic', then 'Install' and 'Done'.
![Kinetic Plugin Install](/images/no-code/Bubble_plugin_install.png)

## Configure the Kinetic Client

The Kinetic Client is what will allow you to interact with Kin on the Solana Blockchain.

Let's get it set up correctly.

Go to 'Plugins' and you'll see some details about the Kinetic plugin that you've just installed, as well as some options we can fill in.

These 'Actions' are the things that the Kinetic plugin can do.

![Kinetic Plugin Actions](/images/no-code/Bubble_plugin_actions.png)

'Local Storage' means that some information is being saved in the browser.
The main actions we care about are the ones explained in-depth below.

In terms of settings, lets keep it simple for now so we can get up and running as quickly as possible.

### Devnet Settings

We want to make sure stuff works on the Solana test environment before moving to the 'mainnet'.

![Kinetic Plugin Settings](/images/no-code/Bubble_plugin_settings.png)

- set your 'endpoint' to `https://sandbox.kinetic.host`
- set your 'environment' to `devnet`
- set your 'index' to your App Index

Don't have an App Index? Register your App on our Developer Portal so you can get your App Index that allows you get credit for your transactions and earn via the KRE.

<RegisterApp />

## Initialize the Kinetic Client

When your App loads we want to 'Intialize the Kinetic Client'. Basically, this means we want to turn on the plugin and make sure it's connected to our Kinetic network correctly.

To do this:

- Go to 'Workflow' on the left-hand menu and add an event for when the page is loaded.

![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_when_page_is_loaded_init.png)

- Then, add an action via `Plugins / Kinetic Init SDK`

![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_when_page_is_loaded_init_sdk_action.png)

- Now, click 'Preview' in the top menu
  ![Preview](/images/no-code/Bubble_preview.png)

- You'll see a blank page. Open the developer tools (`ctrl/shift/i` or `cmd/shift/i`) and select 'Application' this will show you your 'Local Storage'. Select the option for your bubble preview and you should see some values there.
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_when_page_is_loaded_init_sdk_action_preview.png)

  You should see `kineticInitialized = true` and `keypairSet = false`.

  This is because the Kinetic Plugin uses Local Storage for keeping key bits of data that come back from our Kietic network.

  Anything in Local Storage will only last in that specific browser and until the browser is cleared. But, you can close the browser and reopen it and keep the info that's stored there.

  `kineticInitialized = true` means that you are ready to create an account!

## Create Account

Creating an Account is a two step process.

1. Create a Keypair which is consists of:
   - a public key that is an address that people can send Kin to. It's safe to share this.
   - a private key that is used to sign transactions in the browser. This signing is handled by the plugin. It is not safe to share this. Someone with your private key can get access to your funds.

This keypair can be generated fresh or from an existing mnemonic phrase. We'll show you how to do this in a moment.

2. Create an Account on the blockchain with your Keypair.

Let's get started...

- Go to 'Design' and drag a 'Button' onto the blank page. Rename it 'Set Up Keypair'
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_set_up_keypair_button.png)
- Click 'Start/Edit workflow' and add an action via `Plugins / Kinetic Setup Keypair`
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_set_up_keypair_workflow.png)
- Reload your 'Preview' and you'll see your new button on the screen. Click 'Set up keypair' and you should see your new Keypair appear in your Local Storage.
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_set_up_keypair_preview.png)

Lets display the Public Key on the screen for the user.

- Go to 'Design'. Grab a 'Kinetic Local Storage' from the side menu and drag it next to the 'Set Up Keypair' button. Rename it to `KineticLocalStorage Public Key`.
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_public_key_local_storage.png)
- Grab a 'Text' element and place it next to the 'Kinetc Local Storage'. Rename it to `Text Public Key`. Click on '...edit me...' then insert dynamic data.
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_public_key_text.png)
- Set your Dynamic value to `KineticLocalStorage Public Key's Values:last item`.
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_mnemonic_text_value.png)
- Finally, go to your 'Set Up Keypair' workflow, and add an action via `Element Actions / Push a Kinetic Local Storage`.
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_set_up_keypair_workflow_push_local.png)
- Set the element to `KineticLocalStorage Public Key` and in keys put `publicKey`
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_set_up_keypair_workflow_push_local_values.png)
- Reload your 'Preview', click 'Set up Keypair' and you should now see your public key next to your button!
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_set_up_keypair_public_key_preview.png)

Now we want to make it so that a user of the App can view their own mnemonic so they can keep it somewhere safe. That way, we can re-use the mnemonic to make their Keypair instead of having to make a new one.

- Go to 'Design'. Add a new 'Button' called 'Show Mnemonic'.
- Grab a 'Kinetic Local Storage' from the side menu and drag it next to the button. Rename it to `KineticLocalStorage Mnemonic`.
- Grab a 'Text' element and place it next to the 'Kinetc Local Storage'. Rename it to `Text Mnemonic`. Click on '...edit me...' then insert dynamic data.
- Set your Dynamic value to `KineticLocalStorage Mnemonic's Values:last item`.
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_mnemonic_text_value.png)
- Click your 'Show Mnemonic' Button and then 'Start/Edit workflow'.
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_mnemonic_text_action.png)
- Add an action via `Element Actions / Set state`.  
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_mnemonic_button_set_state.png)
- Set your element to `Button Show Mnemonic`. Create a new custom state called `Show Mnemonic` and a type of `yes / no`.
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_mnemonic_button_set_state_new_state.png)
- Set your value to "yes".
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_mnemonic_button_set_state_action.png)
- Go to your 'When Page is loaded' worflow and add an action via `Element Actions / Set state`. Set the element to `Button Show Mnemonic`, the custom state to `Show Mnemonic` and the value to `no`.
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_mnemonic_button_set_state_new_state_init.png)
- Go back to your 'When Button Show Mnemonic is clicked' workflow and add an action via `Element Actions / Push a Kinetic Local Storage`. Set your element to `KineticLocalStorage Mnemonic` and keys to a Dynamic Value of `KineticLocalStorage Public Key's Values:last item`.
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_mnemonic_button_push_local_storage.png)
- Finally, go to 'Design' and click your Text Mnemonic, then select 'Conditional' and 'Define another condition'.
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_mnemonic_text_conditional.png)
- We will use the state on the button we just created. Set 'When' to `Button Show Mnemonic's Show Mnemonic is "yes"`, and 'Property to change when true' to `This element is visible` and set the checkbox to true.
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_mnemonic_text_conditional_value.png)
  ![Page is Loaded](/images/no-code/Bubble_mnemonic_text_conditional_value_full.png)

  Phew!

- Reload your 'Preview'. Now you'll be able to view your mnemonic when you click on the 'Show Mnemonic' button.

## Ready for Production?

You'll need to tweak your app settings once you are ready to run on the 'mainnet' and make real transactions.

### Mainnet Settings

Again, please make sure stuff works on the Solana test environment before moving to the 'mainnet'.

- set your 'endpoint' to `https://sandbox.kinetic.host`
- set your 'environment' to `mainnet`
- set your 'index' to your App Index
