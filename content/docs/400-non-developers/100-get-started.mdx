## Get Started or Add to an Existing Project

Getting started with the Kin No-Code Plugin is incredibly straightforward. Just follow the steps below to start transacting with Kin in your App.

### Create an App on Bubble.io

Create an account on bubble.io

<Bubble />

Then create an App. Give it a name, description, etc. Bubble has a nice App creation wizard you can follow if you'd like.

If you get stuck at this point, you'll probably want to check out [Bubble Academy](https://bubble.io/academy) to get some pointers. There are some great tutorials for beginners that will help get you up to speed with what Bubble is and how you can build an App with it.

### Add the Kinetic Plugin

Once you've created your App, you'll see a menu on the left hand side. Choose 'Plugins'. Then, 'Add plugins'.

```shell

```

### Instantiate the Kinetic Client

The Kinetic Client will give you access to all the methods you need to work with Kin on the blockchain.

We recommend starting with Devnet before moving on to Mainnet.

```

```

Don't have an App Index? Register your App on our Developer Portal so you can get your App Index that allows you to transact with our SDKs and earn via the KRE.

<RegisterApp />

### Create Account

You can create accounts from existing mnemonics or secret keys. In this case we'll generate a mnemonic and use that to creat the keypair we use for creating the account on the blockchain.

```

```

### Check Balance

```

```

### Airdrop Funds (devnet)

```

```

### Transfer Kin

```

```

### Transfer Kin Batch

```

```

### Get Transaction Details

```

```

### Get Solana Explorer URL

[Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/)

```

```

### Get Account History

```

```
